#  🩺  Wound Recognition Backend

This repository contains the backend for a wound recognition application using machine learning.

## Overview

This backend service handles image uploads, processes images through a machine learning model, stores prediction results, and provides API endpoints to interact with these functionalities.

## 📦 Features

- Upload wound images for prediction
- Process images with a TensorFlow/Keras ML model
- Store prediction results in a SQLite database
- Retrieve, delete, and list prediction history
- Designed with a service-based architecture
- Includes unit and integration tests

##  🚀 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy
- TensorFlow
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/koen-sikkema/wound-recognition-backend.git
   cd wound-recognition-backend
   ``` 

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
    venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```py
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload

   ```

The API is now accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000, with interactive documentation available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

## 🧪 Testing
   ```bash 
   pytest -v
   ```
